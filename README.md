# Super Mario 

This little project is my take on the [Code Super Mario in JS series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS8HfBXv9ZWWe8zXrViYbIM2Hhylx8DZx) by [Pontus Alexander](https://twitter.com/pomle). The original source code and other references can be found [here](https://github.com/meth-meth-method/super-mario). Source code in here is written in TypeScript, in contrast to the original's JavaScript, so there are a couple of tweaks and improvements. I really hope that Pontus finally finishes this series, because it's a great material on game dev in JavaScript from scratch. 

## Hot to run it

- clone repository
- Run `pnpm i`
